XNOR_gate class

The XNOR_gate class represents a digital component xnor gate. It has a value of 0 if only one of its inputs'
values is 1, and it has a value of 1 otherwise.

The XNOR_gate evaluate function searches through the inputs vector to find all inputs whose value is 1. If it finds
more than one input whose value is 1, it will return true. If it finds no inputs whose value is 1, it will also return
true. It will return false only if one input has a value of 1.
