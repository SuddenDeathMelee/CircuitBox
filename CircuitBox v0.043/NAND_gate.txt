NAND_gate class

The NAND_gate class represents a digital component nand gate. It has a value of 0 if all of its inputs have
a value of 1, and has a value of true otherwise.

The NAND_gate evaluate function searches through the inputs vector to find a 0. If it finds one, the function
returns true, It will return false otherwise.
